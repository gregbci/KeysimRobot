# KeysimRobot

This is a test program for [robot.js](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs).  Press the send button and then switch to your favorite application.  After a delay, some key strokes will be sent to the application.  This works on Windows 11, macOS 12.x.

Setup with `npm ci` then run using `npm start`

Note - the first time you run this, the OS may ask the user to grant permission for "accessibility features", etc.

To create a package for your platform `npm run package`
