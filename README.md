# KeysimRobot

This is a test program for [robot.js](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs).  It will send keystrokes to the foreground application after a delay then quit.

Setup with `npm ci` then run using `npm start`

Note - the first time you run this, the OS may ask the user to grant permission for "accessibility features", etc.
